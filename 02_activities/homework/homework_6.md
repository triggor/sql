**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

I realize that much of my work has focused on efficiency and accuracy, without fully considering the ethical impact of the data I handle. Data analysis isn’t just about numbers—it affects real lives, especially when it comes to privacy, bias, and unequal access to resources. If the data I work with underrepresents certain groups, my analysis could unintentionally reinforce these disparities.

Going forward, I will be more mindful of the sources of my data, ensuring it's collected fairly and transparently. I’ll also check for biases in both the data and my analysis, using fairness metrics to identify if certain groups are overlooked. Lastly, I’ll advocate for ethical data practices by highlighting limitations and ensuring my insights promote equity.
